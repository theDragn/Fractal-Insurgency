fractal_sppc,WEAPON,"A miniaturized howitzer weapon that fires powerful but inaccurate plasma-based shells. Like most Insurgency weapons, it relies on a built-in recursive causality device to improve its otherwise mediocre performance.

The centerpiece of most of the Insurgency's in-house weapons and more advanced technology, recursive causality devices (RCDs) are capable of changing the dimensions of a volume of space. Typically, this is used to increase from the standard three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension to 3.2 spatial dimensions and 1.04 temporal dimensions. This provides a theoretically limitless amount of self-similar space, matter, and energy, though extracting any of it requires repeated recursion through fractal dimensions. Doing so is heavily chance-based due to the underlying physical process, resulting in the random occurence of desired effects.",,,
fractal_mppc,WEAPON,"A trio of linked cannons fed by a magazine of plasma-based shells. A built-in recursive causality device significantly improves its efficiency, though it still suffers from poor accuracy and a lack of specialization.

While RCDs are perfectly safe as long as one doesn't enter the affected volume (recursive spacetime is rather unfriendly to complicated processing devices like brains), the Domain classified them as causality-violating devices millenia ago and banned them entirely. The Insurgency, of course, cared little for Domain restrictions, and happily used any banned technology they could get their hands on. Frequenly, this led to an unfortunate rebel finding out that the Domain occasionally banned technology for good reason. Today, the RCD is the only illegal tech still in use by the Insurgency, proven ""safe enough"" by millenia of use.",,,
fractal_lppc,WEAPON,"A development of the Plasmatic Pulse Cannon, the Plasmatic Repeater's larger and heavier barrels provide pinpoint accuracyand higher projectile velocity, eliminating the major weakneses of its smaller cousins

One of the early self-produced Insurgency weapons, the Plasmatic Repeater was designed to replace the relatively impractical Mjolnir Cannon.",,,
fractal_sflak,WEAPON,"Fires a triple-shot burst of antimatter proximity shells. The powerful explosive shells are highly effective against fighters and single missiles, but a low rate of fire and abysmal accuracy limits its effectiveness against massed targets.",,,
fractal_ciws,WEAPON,"An older, larger version of the venerable Vulcan Cannon. Modern improvements to ammunition provide somewhat improved effectiveness against fighters at the cost of flux efficiency.",,,
fractal_lflak,WEAPON,A gas-operated rotary cannon that fires antimatter proximity shells. Requires a few shots to accelerate the barrel mechanism to maximum speed.,,,
fractal_simpactor,WEAPON,A very flux-efficient anti-shield solution that sacrifices accuracy and power for efficiency and volume of fire.,,,
fractal_mimpactor,WEAPON,"An array of extremely efficient electromagnetic drivers that fire flechette ammunition at a constant rate, compensating for a near-total lack of accuracy with pure volume of fire.",,,
fractal_mblast,WEAPON,"A powerful but inaccurate anti-armor cannon that dates back to the earliest eras of space warfare. This modernized version uses a recursive causality device to improve its performance, though not in a reliable fashion.",,,
fractal_lblast,WEAPON,"Equipped with a quartet of barrels that fire salvos of anti-armor shells, the Quad Blastcannon serves as a generic anti-armor solution, with decent all-round performance and reasonably low flux generation.",,,
fractal_mhdgun,WEAPON,"Cursed with an uncomfortably long name, the Magnetohydrodynamic Driver uses magnetic fields to fire exotic liquid ammunition at extremely high velocities. While it has less raw damage output than other large ballistic weapons, it compensates with pinpoint accuracy and shield-disrupting ammunition.",,,
fractal_wailer_m,WEAPON,"A design discarded by the Domain in favor of the now-ubiquitous Harpoon, the Wailer favors quantity over quality. It may not have the same anti-armor power or guidance algorithm, but with double the missiles in the magazine, it hardly matters.",,,
fractal_shrieker_s,WEAPON,"Shrieker AM torpedoes consist of an antimatter-catalyzed microfusion warhead mated to a self-aiming torpedo body. They have an excellent top speed thanks to their lightweight warhead, though their default guidance algorithm is somewhat less than perfect.",,,
fractal_shrieker_m,WEAPON,Fires a quartet of Shrieker AM torpedoes in rapid succession. The close proximity of multiple torpedo engines decreases the accuracy of the default guidance algorithm.,,,
fractal_gyro_s,WEAPON,Rapidly fires self-aiming gyrojet projectiles with an extremely high top speed and constant acceleration.,,,
fractal_gyro_m,WEAPON,"Fires self-aiming gyrojet projectiles from a sizeable internal magazine. The missiles have an extremely high top speed and accelerate continuously, but lack any guidance after an initial aiming stage.",,,
fractal_kintorp,WEAPON,"Launches a frangible kinetic torpedo that fractures as it takes damage, creating high-velocity kinetic shrapnel.",,,
