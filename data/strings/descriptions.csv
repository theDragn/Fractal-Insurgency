fractal_sppc,WEAPON,"A miniaturized howitzer weapon that fires powerful but inaccurate plasma-based shells. Like most Insurgency weapons, it relies on a built-in recursive causality device to improve its otherwise mediocre performance.

The centerpiece of most of the Insurgency's in-house weapons and more advanced technology, recursive causality devices (RCDs) are capable of changing the dimensions of a volume of space. Typically, this is used to increase from the standard three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension to 3.2 spatial dimensions and 1.04 temporal dimensions. This provides a theoretically limitless amount of self-similar space, matter, and energy, though extracting any of it requires repeated recursion through fractal dimensions. Doing so is heavily chance-based due to the underlying physical process, resulting in the random occurence of desired effects.",,,
fractal_mppc,WEAPON,"A trio of linked cannons fed by a magazine of plasma-based shells. A built-in recursive causality device significantly improves its efficiency, though it still suffers from poor accuracy and a lack of specialization.

While RCDs are perfectly safe as long as one doesn't enter the affected volume (recursive spacetime is rather unfriendly to complicated processing devices like brains), the Domain classified them as causality-violating devices millenia ago and banned them entirely. The Insurgency, of course, cared little for Domain restrictions, and happily used any banned technology they could get their hands on. Frequenly, this led to an unfortunate rebel finding out that the Domain occasionally banned technology for good reason. Today, the RCD is the only illegal tech still in use by the Insurgency, proven ""safe enough"" by millenia of use.",,,
fractal_lppc,WEAPON,"A development of the Plasmatic Pulse Cannon, the Plasmatic Repeater's larger and heavier barrels provide pinpoint accuracyand higher projectile velocity, eliminating the major weakneses of its smaller cousins

One of the early self-produced Insurgency weapons, the Plasmatic Repeater was designed to replace the relatively impractical Mjolnir Cannon.",,,
fractal_sflak,WEAPON,"Fires a triple-shot burst of antimatter proximity shells. The powerful explosive shells are highly effective against fighters and single missiles, but a low rate of fire and abysmal accuracy limits its effectiveness against massed targets.",,,
fractal_ciws,WEAPON,"An older, larger version of the venerable Vulcan Cannon. Modern improvements to ammunition provide somewhat improved effectiveness against fighters at the cost of flux efficiency.",,,
fractal_lflak,WEAPON,A gas-operated rotary cannon that fires antimatter proximity shells. Requires a few shots to accelerate the barrel mechanism to maximum speed.,,,
fractal_simpactor,WEAPON,"A cut-down version of the standard impactor array, with half the firepower and reduced range. Delivers an enormous volume of fire for a small weapon, in an equally inaccurate manner.",,,
fractal_mimpactor,WEAPON,"A bootleg version of the Needler, the Impactor Array fires the same flechette ammunition at a constant rate, compensating for a near-total lack of accuracy with pure volume of fire and an integrated recursive causality device.",,,
fractal_mblast,WEAPON,"One of only a few high-performance weapons in the Insurgency arsenal, the Blastcannon is an ancient cousin to the Heavy Mauler, trading the latter's long range for simpler operation and a slight improvement in damage output.",,,
fractal_lblast,WEAPON,"A simplistic method of producing a larger version of the Twin Blastcannon, the quad variant simply mounts two of them side-by-side in a larger mount with improved stabilizers and longer barrels.",,,
fractal_mhdgun,WEAPON,"Blessed with an uncomfortably long name, the Magnetohydrodynamic Driver uses magnetic fields to fire exotic liquid ammunition at extremely high velocities. Despite its relatively low raw damage output, the liquid ammunition is extremely disruptive to shield emitters, making it a go-to weapon for cracking high-efficiency shields.",,,
