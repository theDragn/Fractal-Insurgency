fractal_sppc,WEAPON,"A miniaturized howitzer weapon that fires large-caliber plasma-based shells. Like most Insurgency weapons, it relies on a built-in recursive causality device to improve its otherwise mediocre performance.

The centerpiece of most of the Insurgency's in-house weapons and more advanced technology, recursive causality devices (RCDs) are capable of changing the dimensions of a volume of space. Typically, this is used to increase from the standard three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension to 3.2 spatial dimensions and 1.04 temporal dimensions. This provides a theoretically limitless amount of self-similar space, matter, and energy, though extracting any of it requires repeated recursion through fractal dimensions. Doing so is heavily chance-based due to the underlying physical process, resulting in the random occurence of desired effects.",,,
fractal_mppc,WEAPON,"A trio of linked cannons fed by a magazine of plasma-based shells. A built-in recursive causality device significantly improves its efficiency, though it still suffers from poor accuracy and a lack of specialization.

While RCDs are perfectly safe as long as one doesn't enter the affected volume (recursive spacetime is rather unfriendly to complicated processing devices like brains), the Domain classified them as causality-violating devices millenia ago and banned them entirely. The Insurgency, of course, cared little for Domain restrictions, and happily used any banned technology they could get their hands on. Frequenly, this led to an unfortunate rebel finding out that the Domain occasionally banned technology for good reason. Today, the RCD is the only illegal tech still in use by the Insurgency, proven ""safe enough"" by millenia of use.",,,
fractal_lppc,WEAPON,"A development of the Plasmatic Pulse Cannon, the Plasmatic Repeater's larger and heavier barrels provide pinpoint accuracy, eliminating the major weakness of its smaller cousins. The larger mount size provides additional room for autoloader machinery, improving the weapon's overall firepower.

One of the early self-produced Insurgency weapons, the Plasmatic Repeater was designed to replace the relatively impractical Mjolnir Cannon.",,,
fractal_sflak,WEAPON,"Fires a triple-shot burst of antimatter proximity shells. A built-in recursive causality device can divert an extra projectile out of fractal dimensions, though not particularly reliably.",,,
fractal_mflak,WEAPON,A six-barreled flak cannon that fires antimatter proximity shells.,,,
